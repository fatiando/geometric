Installing
==========


Which Python?
-------------

You'll need **Python 3.5 or greater** to run GMT Python.

We recommend using the `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads#all>`__ Python
distribution to ensure you have all dependencies installed and the ``conda``
package manager available.
Installing Anaconda does not require administrative rights to your computer and
doesn't interfere with any other Python installations in your system.
