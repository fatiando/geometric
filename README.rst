Imposter syndrome disclaimer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source. We
are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from those
mistakes. That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**. Equality important
contributions include: writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting or
implementing tests, or even giving feedback about the project (including giving
feedback about the contribution process). If you're coming to the project with
fresh eyes, you might see the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors
have glossed over.
